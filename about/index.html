<span>Nov 27, 2022</span></div><div class=tags></div></div><article class=post><div class=post-content><p>My name is Nhat Minh Nguyen, but these days I usually go with &ldquo;Nathan&rdquo; living in an English-speaking country. I am from Saigon, Vietnam. I currently live in Brisbane after moving here at the beginning of 2020.</p><p>I graduated from <a href=https://www.uq.edu.au/>University of Queensland</a> in December 2022 with a Bachelor&rsquo;s (Honours) degree in Software Engineering.</p><h2 id=experience>Experience</h2><p>My first ever job was a part-time job as a teaching assistant at a programming school named <a href=https://www.facebook.com/BigOCoding>Big-O Coding</a> in Saigon.</p><p>At the end of 2020, I worked for 3 months at a start-up in Brisbane doing mobile development with Flutter.</p><p>During my final year at UQ (2021), I did my thesis project at <a href=https://research.csiro.au/qcat/>QCAT - CSIRO</a>. The project was on 3D LiDAR Semantic Segmentation using deep learning methods.</p><h2 id=interests>Interests</h2><p>I love programming and problem-solving going hand-in-hand. I love solving problems through the means of expressive and concise code, regardless of the programming languages or paradigms.</p><p>The topic that fascinated me the most in Computer Science would be classical Algorithms & Data Structures (those that one would find in the CLRS book). These days, I am quite interested in Compilers and Program Analysis. There are topics that I would love to study more in-depth, namely Machine Learning & Statistics, Optimization, Computer Networking & Security, Numerical Analysis, and Cryptography.</p><h2 id=programming-languages>Programming Languages</h2><p>Programming Languages that I have used quite a lot include C, C++, Java, Python, and TypeScript. I learned some Scala during my last semester at uni and tried using it for <a href=https://adventofcode.com/2021/>Advent of Code 2021</a> (<a href=https://github.com/nathan-wien/aoc-2021>my solutions</a>). I plan to study Rust sometime in the future - it looks like a language for me.</p><p>I have no strong opinion of which programming language is the best. I am evenly happy to use any language, as long as it is suitable for the job :).</p><h2 id=tools>Tools</h2><p>The current daily driver on my main laptop is Ubuntu 20.04 with <a href=https://i3wm.org/>i3</a> window-manager. All of my dotfiles can be found <a href=https://github.com/nathan-wien/dotfiles>here</a>. At the same time, I can work comfortably on any OSes (Windows, Mac) and adapt quickly to any development environment. Windows and Mac have their own upsides when it comes to different kinds of work.</p><p>For text editors, I am a <a href=neovim.io>neovim</a> user. At the same time, I think VSCode is a very fine piece of technology, paving the way for the <a href=https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/>Language Server Protocol</a> that allows for real-time auto-completion, linting, and other useful features (without which my neovim experience would not be at great, so thanks VSCode!). I am also a big fan of JetBrains IDEs.</p><h2 id=hobbies>Hobbies</h2><p>Outside of computer programming, I have other hobbies as well.</p><ul><li><p>I love music. My favorite genre to listen to is Classic Rock (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Vzl0dEtJegEWdtuxeCHMo?si=3284cf2eacbc4a0e">my Spotify playlist</a>). I play classical guitar when I am not too busy. Some of my favourite classical guitar pieces can be found here <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD0K1bPRzzfG8FaJjLiipOi6iQKRZJmQv">(Youtube playlist)</a>. My favourite classical guitar composer is, of course, TÃ¡rrega. My favourite piano composers are Liszt and Chopin.</p></li><li><p>I love watching sports. I can watch any kind of sports, from football, to chess, to e-sports. My main motivation for watching sports, besides the sports themselves, is getting to see the personalities of the players shining through.</p></li><li><p>I love learning about Psychology. At some point, I was thinking to myself that, had I not chosen to study Computer Science/Software Engineering, Psychology would be a highly-viable choice.</p></li></ul></div></article></div><footer id=footer class=footer><div class=social-links><a href=https://facebook.com/nhat.nguyen.sg.vn class="iconfont icon-facebook" title=facebook target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a>
